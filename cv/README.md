## About me

I’m a versatile data science consultant based in Madrid. I’m capable of helping clients to solve their problems creatively and handle complex databases to obtain precise, understandable and useful insights. I have many years of analytical experience and I've recently started to fully adapt to a professional environment where I am involved in a cross functional client's project as well as several internal projects involving machine learning pipelines.

My experience helps me apply skills like teamwork, meeting deadlines, and communicating results and complex ideas effectively to a non-technical audience. I'm a curious and fast learner of latest techniques in data science.

### [Institute of Physics of Cantabria (CSIC-UC)](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us)
#### Researcher *(January 2014 – December 2019)*
Analyzed data [for the PhD Thesis research](#university-of-cantabria) using information the Bright Ultra-hard XMM-Newton Survey (BUXS) to study the relation between the UV/optical extinction, X-ray absorption and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei.

- Analyzed datasets of 258 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using proprietary observations and public spectra.
- Created Python code and adapted others to detect emission lines or to measure best fitting models for big spectral datasets.
- Planned numerical simulations to measure the nuclear obscuration of AGN and its emission properties.
- Prepared and presented 10 talks and posters presenting results in conferences.
- Coordinated outreach activities that include public astronomical observations, outdoor outreach activities, talks at schools and public visits to the IFCA installations.
- Teacher of astronomy practices for studies of the Physics Degree in the Universidad de Cantabria (35 hours in total taught in Spanish and English).

### [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/)
#### Doctor in Science and Technology with a distinction "cum laude" *(January 2014 – December 2019)*  


I studied the relation between the UV/optical extinction (AV) and the X-ray absorption (NH) in type-1 AGN using the Bright Ultra-hard XMM-Newton Survey (BUXS). We have conducted two different studies. In the first one we have two type-1.9 AGN (high AV) with low NH so we study this discordance. In the second one, we have conducted a statistical study of a representative study of 132 type-1 AGN. We analysed the optical and X-ray spectra to obtain AV and NH, the intrinsic luminosity and fluxes and widths of the emission lines.

In the first study we obtained that low absorbed type-1 AGN do not form a physical family of objects, as the discordance in each object is caused by different factors.

In the second one we obtained that AV and NH are related with the optical subclassification and that for type-1 AGN, extinction and absorption are not correlated.

### [University of La Laguna](https://www.ull.es/en/)
#### Master's Degree in Astrophysics *(September 2012 - July 2013)*
Specialization in “Computation and Theory” and “Technology and Instrumentation”

My first contact with Machine Learning was during my Master Thesis work. It consisted in a modification of the K-means unsupervised clustering algorithm, that we modified updating the cluster centroids "on the fly" (single-pass k-means, [Ordovás-Pascual & Sánchez Almeida 2014](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2014/05/aa23806-14/aa23806-14.html)). Tested in a subsample of 20000 galaxy spectra, we reached a decrease of the computation time (between 20-40%) with respect to the K-means traditional approach, obtaining equivalent classifications.


#### Bachelor's Degree in Physics *(September 2005 - September 2012)*
I conducted the first part of my Physics degree in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. I moved to the Canary Islands and I finished my degree in the Universidad de La Laguna with a specialization in astrophysics.
