I’m always practicing and learning new tools to improve my data scientist and coding skills. In this page you can find some exercises I've done in [Cognizant as a data scientist](#cognizant-related-projects), in the [Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp](#ironhack-bootcamp-projects) and [on my own](#self-paced-projects). Feel free to have a look at [my personal GitHub account](https://github.com/ordovas/) as well!

Also, I've deployed some demos in Streamlit with data science models I've developed. [Click here to run them online.](https://share.streamlit.io/ordovas/private_streamlit_apps/main/app.py)

## Cognizant related highlights

#### Invited talk about GenAI at FOSSCILT 24:
I was an invited speaker at the FOSSCILT 24 conference:

https://fosscilt.icfoss.org/

We gave a presentation about the performance of LLMs with mathematical operations. [Click here to watch it it.](https://www.youtube.com/live/KaiTZIsTBYk?si=fusV0_Osfi5NkrTR&t=4042)

#### Azure Percept object detection case study

I'm collaborating in many Computer Vision case studies at Cognizant. As a data science consultant, I'm in charge of creating deep learning models or other AI approaches to solve customer needs. 

Microsoft offered a bootcamp to test [Azure Percept](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-percept/), an IoT device for creating edge AI solutions. The case study we've created is a general fruit detection model using Azure Percept, Custom vision and IoT Hub. In this video you can have a look at our approach.

In the Microsoft's Internet of Things Blog we have published an entry describing our approach. [Click here to read it.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/retail-self-checkout-object-detection-solution-using-azure/ba-p/3072914)

#### Automated maintenance - Rust detection

Using deep learning approaches, I've contributed to the automatic rust detection in a case study. Below I show blog posts and the description of the solution as shown in the Cognizant media:

- [From personnel-based operations to AI-driven automated maintenance](https://www.thecognizant.com/blog/from-personnel-based-operations-to-ai-driven-automated-maintenance/)
- [Aize aims to cut asset surface inspection costs by 50%](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/case-studies/aize-cuts-asset-surface-inspection-costs)

## Self-paced projects

Also, I highlight the following self paced exercises I've done for practicing and learning purposes that are public:

- [A small Web scraping and RegEx exercise to mine the japanese hardware and software video game sales.](https://github.com/ordovas/vg_jp_sales)

- [Predicting the numeric ratings of Amazon books review based exclusively on the text of the review.](https://github.com/ordovas/amazon_books_reviews)

- [As stated above, I deployed some data science demos in Streamlit I've developed that can be run them online.](https://share.streamlit.io/ordovas/private_streamlit_apps/main/app.py)



Feel free to have a look at other repositories [here](https://github.com/ordovas/) with other exercises, learning notebooks & code or just simple tests, even if they are uncompleted or not interesting enough to be shown in the profile.
